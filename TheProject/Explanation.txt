The way it works:

 

1. The `hash_file` function receives a filename and returns the SHA-1 hash of the file's content. This function reads the file in binary mode and reads it chunk by chunk to create a hash. This method works for large files as well if the file is too large to fit in memory.

2. `delete_duplicate_images` function is the main function acting as follows:
    - `{hash: {name: filename}}` is a dictionary that stores the hashes of the image files as keys and their names along with their line numbers in the `files.csv` file as values.
    - It reads the `files.csv` file line by line. Each line is assumed to contain the name (path) of each image file.
    - For each filename, it checks if the file exists. If not, it skips to the next file.
    - If the file exists, it calculates the fileâ€™s hash using the `hash_file` function.
    - If the calculated hash value is not already in the dictionary, the hash is added to the dictionary with the corresponding file name and its line number.
    - If it is already in the dictionary, it means the image is a duplicate. Then it removes the file and records it in the `removed_files` dictionary with the filename as key and a tuple containing the hash and line number as its value.

3. After scanning all the image files, it writes the file name, hash, and line number of the deleted (duplicate) files into `deleted_files.csv`.

4. By running this script, duplicates of image files will be detected by their content (not by filename) and removed. Also, a record of information about deleted (duplicate) files is created.

This script should scan all the images, find duplicates by their content, delete the duplicates, and log the deleted duplicates in a .csv file. 


Cool Fact:
We are using a dictionary here. The dictionary in Python is a built-in data structure that can be used to store a collection of values. In our code, we are using it to map a hash value (key) to a file name and its line number (value). A particular characteristic of dictionary keys is that they must be unique, which makes them ideal for efficiently checking if a hash already exists or not.
